    Description:
    Fits the model to the training dataset contained in x and y.
    Args:
    x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
    y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1: (number of training examples, 1).
    theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
    alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate
    max_iter: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent
    Returns:
    new_theta: numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension 2 * 1.
    None if there is a matching dimension problem.
    Raises:
    This function should not raise any Exception.
