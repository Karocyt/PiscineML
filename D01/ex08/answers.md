# Exercise 8 - Question Time!

## 1 - What is a hypothesis and what is its goal? (Itâ€™s a second chance for you to say something intelligible, no need to thank us!)

a hypothesis is a suggested equation to fit the data. When working, it's goal would be to predict the outcome on new data.

## 2 - What is the cost function and what does it represent?

it's a mesurement of out error. The further away from zero the worst.

## 3 - What is Linear Gradient Descent and what does it do? (hint: you have to talk about J, its gradient and the theta parameters. . . )

the gradient mesure the slope of the curve of J depending on each parameter. it tells us wich way (+/-) and how much (the absolute value) to update our parameters

## 4 - What happens if you choose a learning rate that is too large?

overshooting/diverging

## 5 - What happens if you choose a very small learning rate, but still a sufficient number of cycles?

it works.

## 6 - Can you explain MSE and what it measures?

Mean Squarred Error: Mean of the raw error squarred, used to penalize heavily outliers
